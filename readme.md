## To build the document:
1) `./compile.sh`, duh. Depends on pdflatex, bibtex, and miktex

## Nomenclature  
* All your text should go into `kapitel/`.
* All your indices, such as acronyms, references, glossary entrys, if not generated automatically, should go into `dexes/`

# Other stuff worth noting
* All paths must be relative to project root! (where `compile.sh` lies).
* Configure your projects base informations such as title, author, year, etc in `config.tex`.
